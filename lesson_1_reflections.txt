How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I was able to compare the 2 files which contained the old and the new version

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
you get to see previous changes made to your current project

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros- you get to save version after a logical change has been performed

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately? 
Maybe, because Git has access to all the files of a folder

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log can be used to see all the recent commits made
git diff can be used to see the differences between commits made between two commit ids
